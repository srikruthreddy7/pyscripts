User: At a rooftop unit, Gina was not calling for cooling at the thermostat. But it's controlled on a computer. So I jumped it at the board, Only the only the blower came on. And now it turned off, and it's showing 2 flashes, which means control waiting ASCD.
AI: Sounds like you're dealing with a communication issue between the thermostat and the rooftop unit. The 2 flashes indicating control waiting ASCD usually means the control board isn't receiving the right signals or it's waiting for a command from they. Thermostat, Since you jumped it at the board and only the blower came on, it's possible the compressor isn't getting the signal to kick on. You might wanna check the wiring between the control board and the thermostat and also verify if the thermostat itself is functioning properly. If the wiring looks solid, it might be worth diving into the computer control settings to ensure everything's configured correctly. Have you had a chance to check the field piece data? That could give more insight into any errors or issues.
User: No current data. The system is not running.
AI: Got it. Without the current data, a bit flying blind, but we can still troubleshoot. Since the system's not running, let's focus on the basics. First, check the power to the rooftop unit. Ensure the disconnect is closed, and there's power at the unit. Also, look at the fuses or breakers. A blown fuse can kill the control signal, Then, inspect the control board for any visible damages or burnt components. It's also worth checking any safety switches. Like float switches or high limit switches. To make sure nothing's tripped. Once you verify power and safety devices, might need to manually check the voltage outputs from the control board to see if it sending the right signals to the components. If you can get the field piece data after that, we might get a clearer picture.
User: I got the right amount of voltage coming in.
AI: That's a good start. With the right voltage coming in, it sounds like the power supply is solid. Now, let's check the output voltage from the control board, You should be looking for signals to the compressor and other components. If you're getting the right voltage out, but the system still won't engage, it might point to a faulty control board or a communication issue. Also, don't forget to verify the connections at the compressor and fan fan. Sometimes, a loose or corroded connection can cause those components to not receive their power even if everything looks good upstream. If you want to get the field piece data now, that might give us more clues to work with.
AI: Alright. Diagnosing it now.
AI: The analysis shows everything operating within normal ranges.
AI: Suction line temperature is at 55 degrees. And liquid line temperature is at 55.9 degrees. Which is balanced. Super heat is around 18 degrees, hitting typical expectations. The supply and return temperatures and humidities are consistent. Indicating no major static pressure or airflow problems. So it looks like the system is functioning well overall. If you're still having issues, you might want to focus on the signals to the compressor or any settings in the computer control.
User: What should I look at first?
AI: Since the system seems to be operating normally, but you're still having issues with the compressor not engaging. I'd recommend starting with the control signals from the board. Check for voltage output at the compressor contactor when the system is calling for cooling If there's no voltage there, it's likely the control board or the thermostat is the culprit. Also, verify the communication between the thermostat and the control system. If those check out, then you may need to look into the control settings on that computer system to see if anything's been misconfigured. Just keep an eye on those connections and verify continuity while you're at it. I'm here to help with any questions you have. Is there something specific you're looking
User: No. Um, I found the problem. Thank you.
AI: Glad to hear you found the problem. If you need any more help or have questions down the line, just give me a shout.

AI: Alright. Diagnosing it now.
AI: Sorry. Might take a sec. Working through it now.
AI: Alright. Here's what I see. Static pressures look solid. Return side at negative 0.119 and supply at positive 0.201. Delta is 0.32. So airflow is not being strangled anywhere obvious. The real standout is your electrical readings. You've got 0 volts and 0 amps showing. So either the unit's not powered or you've got a wiring or breaker issue. I'd check the disconnect and breaker panel first before chasing other ghosts. On the refrigerant side, superheat is sitting at 15 degrees. Which is acceptable But your sub cool is only 2.4, could be a sign of undercharge. Once you confirm the unit is actually powered up, double check your refrigerant charge. Especially since it's running r 32. But, yeah, step 1 is definitely making sure this thing's actually getting power.
AI: Got the updated field piece data with voltage and amperage readings this time.
AI: Let me run the diagnosis on this set real quick. Alright. Diagnosing it now. Sorry. Might take a sec. Working through it now.
AI: Alright. With this latest set of readings, your voltage is solid at 244.7 an in periage is 3.7. Which is totally normal for a smaller or variable speed unit. Static pressure delta is 0.32. Again, right in the sweet spot for airflow. So no duct or filter drama. Superheat is at 15.5. Which is slightly lower than the typical 1 8 2 0 range, but still acceptable especially with your humidity levels. Subcooling is at 1.8, so refrigerant charge is just a hair low, but not enough to cause big issues. Overall, nothing jumps out as a problem here. The system looks like it's running as expected. If you're seeing any symptoms, you might wanna keep an eye on that charge. But otherwise, you're good.
